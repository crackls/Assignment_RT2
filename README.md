Research Track 2 Assignment
===========================
Here in this repository you can find the code for the third and final assignment of the 
course Research Track 2, done by Carlos Ángel López de Rodas Serrano.

This assignment is divided into three parts:
* Full documentation of the final assignment of Research Track 1
* New user interface of the final assignment of Research Track 1 using a jupyter notebook
* Perform a statistical analysis comparing two different approaches for the first assignment of Research Track 1

First Part
----------------------
All the documentation has been done using Doxygen, and all the comented code can be found in the folder doc

Second Part
----------------------
Before running the jupyter notebook, start the simulation enviroment:
```bash
$ roslaunch final_assignment init.launch
```
Then, run the jupyter notebook, `Jupyter_UI.ipynb`

Third Part
----------------------
For the third and last part, there are two documents, `RT2_Part_3_final_as.pdf` which
is the report of the statistical analysis and `RT2.xlsx`, an excel file containing all
the data collected in order to compare between the performances of the approaches.
